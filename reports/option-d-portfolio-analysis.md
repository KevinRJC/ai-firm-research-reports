## Gamma Exposure & Market Maker Rebalancing Risk

### The Gamma Feedback Loop

When large-cap tech stocks drop 10%+, market makers must rebalance:

1. **Negative Gamma Zone**: MMs are short gamma on put options
2. **Forced Selling**: As prices drop, they must SELL more stock to hedge
3. **Amplification**: This creates a FEEDBACK LOOP amplifying the drop

### Estimated Impact on SPY

| Symbol | Direct Impact | With Gamma (2.5x) |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| NVDA | -0.68% | -1.70% |
| AAPL | -0.71% | -1.77% |
| MSFT | -0.69% | -1.73% |
| GOOGL | -0.41% | -1.02% |
| META | -0.26% | -0.65% |
| **TOTAL** | **-2.75%** | **-6.88%** |

### SPY Price Scenarios

- Current SPY: **$690.31**
- After direct impact only: **$671.33**
- After gamma cascade: **$642.85**
